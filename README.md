# Forever E-commerce Project

🟢 Featured Project | React & Front-end Focus

This is a React-based e-commerce website that I developed as my main front-end portfolio project.
The project started as a tutorial-based learning exercise, and I have been continuously improving it by adding my own features, optimizations, and design adjustments. Currently, at least 10% of the code and logic is my own work, and I plan to increase it further as I refine the project.

## Key Features
- Browse products and categories with dynamic UI
- Add to cart, update quantities, and remove items
- Cart summary with subtotal calculation
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
- User-friendly interface with smooth interactions

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS / Tailwind CSS

## Learning & Improvement Notes
- Refactored tutorial code to improve component structure and readability

**Note:** This project represents my growth from following tutorials to creating and refining a React application. It demonstrates my current front-end skills and readiness for junior front-end roles.
